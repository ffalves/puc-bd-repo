This project is part of the conclusion work of the first semester of the Technological Degree in Databases course at PUC Minas University.

My group decided to analyze the public data of Brazilian financial institutions. The set of documents is csv files were extracted manually from the website and refer to quarterly financial summaries between 2010 and 2020. It is accessible here: https://www3.bcb.gov.br/ifdata/

For this first version, after extraction, we did the data transformation with R in RStudio. And the result was a csv file.
